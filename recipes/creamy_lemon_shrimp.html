    This lovely lemon garlic shrimp dish with spaghetti pasta is deliciously creamy and comes together in just 30
    minutes, making it perfect for busy weeknights!
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>4 zucchini</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups homemade or store-bought tomato sauce</li>
    <li>⅔ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups bechamel sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
    <li>¼ cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,
      until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season shrimp with salt and pepper;
      add to the pan and cook 30 seconds per side. Remove to a plate.</li>
    <li>Add shallots to the skillet and cook for 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in
      chicken broth, lemon zest, and 1/2 of the lemon juice; heat for 2 minutes. Reserve remaining lemon juice for
      another use.</li>
    <li>Add cream and bring to a simmer. Return shrimp to the skillet and cook until heated through and pink, 2 to 3
      minutes. Add basil.</li>
    <li>Drain spaghetti, reserving 1/4 to 1/2 cup pasta water.
    </li>
    <li>Add spaghetti to the skillet. Add pasta water as needed and pepper flakes; toss to coat. Season with pepper if
      desired.</li>
  </ol>
